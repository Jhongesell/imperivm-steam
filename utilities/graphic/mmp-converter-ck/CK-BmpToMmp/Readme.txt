HOW TO USE IT:
I belive that all you need to know is written down in the program itself. Here I can add only that:
1. The source and destination paths you can also pass as the command line parameters(first  source then destination path).
2. To chose program current directory type '.' (without '' ofc)

Enjoy :)
